In today’s fast-paced world, owning a vehicle is more than a convenience; it’s a necessity.

This is where roadside assistance as a part of motor insurance becomes invaluable. In India, understanding the significance of roadside assistance can ensure that drivers are never left stranded.

What is Roadside Assistance?

Roadside assistance is an add-on service provided by motor insurance companies to help drivers deal with various on-road emergencies. This service is designed to offer immediate help in situations such as vehicle breakdowns, flat tires, battery issues, fuel shortages, and even accidents. The goal is to provide prompt and effective support to minimize inconvenience and ensure the safety of the driver and passengers. Roadside assistance packages typically offer a range of services, including:

Towing Service: If a vehicle cannot be repaired on-site, it can be towed to the nearest garage or a preferred location.
Battery Jump-Start: Assistance with starting a vehicle if the battery is dead.
Flat Tire Change: Help with replacing a flat tire with the spare.
Fuel Delivery: Provision of a limited amount of fuel if the vehicle runs out of petrol or diesel.
Lockout Service: Assistance in case the driver is locked out of the vehicle.
On-site Mechanical Repairs: Minor repairs that can be done on-site to get the vehicle back on the road.
Benefits of Roadside Assistance:

Including roadside assistance in motor insurance offers several benefits, such as:

Peace of Mind: Knowing that help is just a phone call away can provide immense peace of mind, especially during long trips or in unfamiliar areas.
Safety: Roadside assistance ensures that drivers are not left stranded in potentially dangerous situations, such as on highways or in isolated locations.
Convenience: Prompt and professional help minimizes downtime and inconvenience, allowing drivers to get back on the road quickly.
Cost Savings: Many roadside assistance services are included in the insurance policy, which can save significant out-of-pocket expenses during emergencies.
To avail of roadside assistance, the insured needs to contact the insurance company’s roadside assistance hotline, which is typically available 24/7 and provide necessary details such as policy number, location, and the nature of the problem. Then, the insurance company will dispatch a service provider to assist with the issue.
